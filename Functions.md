a function is the mathematical relationship that maps each value of a set of inputs to a single output

the notation f(x) is used to represent a function of x

-  the set of possible inputs for a function is called the domain
- the set of possible outputs of a function is called the range
- the roots of a function f(x) are the values of x where f(x) = 0
- a monic polynomial has 1 as its first coefficient

for a function with integer exponents $x^n$ there is n roots in the complex plane, however the number of solutions in the real plane is limited
## Discriminant

in a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ the discriminant is $b^2 - 4ac$

the discriminant is part of the quadratic equation $$\frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
- if the discriminant is 0, the function has 1 repeated root
- if the discriminant is below 0, the function has no real roots (square root of a negative is not real)
- if the discriminant is above 0, the function has 2 distinct roots

1: express
$2(a^2 + b^2)$ 
in the form
$x^2 + y^2$
where
$a,b,x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$ 


2: express
$a^2u^2+a^2v^2+b^2u^2+b^2v^2$
in the form
$x^2+y^2$
where 
$a,b,u,v,x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$ 

3: write all primes below 20 and note which ones can be expressed as the sum of 2 squares
find the pattern (spoiled by next question)

------- 


4: prove that all numbers of the form $4k-1$ cannot be expressed as the sum of two squares

5: suppose you have a group of 5 people, where each person knows at least 3 other people, if a knows b, b knows a automatically.
is it always the case that you have a group of 3 people who all know each other

6: similarly, if you have a group of 6 people, where each person knows at least 4 people, but one person knows 5 people, is it always the case you will have a group of 4 people who all know each other

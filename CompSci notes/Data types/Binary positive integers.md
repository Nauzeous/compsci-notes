computers are digital, as opposed to analog

this means that they can only represent ==discrete values==

a bit is a single binary digit, capable of holding a 0 (off) or a 1 (on)

only two values can be represented for simplicity and to make them less error-prone

the two states of on or off, 0 or 1 can be represented in multiple ways

## Physical binary

In RAM, bits are represented by capacitors that either hold a charge (1) or do not hold a charge (0)

In magnetic drives, bits are stored in polarities, north for 0, south for 1

On optical disks, 0 and 1 are represented by how the light reflects on the disk, either reflected or not

Solid state media stores data by trapping or freeing electrons, moving them between an oxide layer, representing either 0 or 1



**sequences of bits can be interpreted in a vast number of ways (ie. image, sound, instruction, character)**


## Bases

the standard number system is base 10, a single digit can range from 0-9, then the next value would require a second digit (10)

while base 10 is convenient to humans for various reasons, base 2 is much more convenient for computers, as it suits the use of two states. 

**Base 16 is also used for hexadecimal, but based on the base 2 binary system**

if the number base is *n*, each new digit in a number is n times larger than the last

	...100, 10, 1

the second digit in base 10 holds values 10 times larger than the first digit, and the third digit holds values 10 times larger than the second digit, etc.

similarly, base 2 is 

	 ...8, 4, 2, 1

therefore the number 0 1 1 0 is treated as 

	(0*8) + (1*4) + (1*2) + (0*1)

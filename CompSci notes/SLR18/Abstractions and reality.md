reality can be abstracted in order to extract data that is important in context

by only conveying important information, it makes data specific to a purpose, and easier to use/manipulate

graphs are an example of an abstraction, only the values of the edges and nodes are stored, and nothing else

by abstracting graphs, they can be represented in different ways, like an adjacency list/matrix or a different more straightforward graph

A real world example of abstraction is the london tube map, which mostly ignores geography and detail for the sake of making the train system easy to navigate

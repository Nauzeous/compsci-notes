when creating an abstract model, a rule of thumb is "less is more", think about the context of the abstraction, and all data that could be relevant to the abstraction

flowcharts are a good way of abstracting code

programming as a whole is built on the concept of abstractions, even assembly code abstracts complexity prevalent in binary code

variables, procedures, functions, OOP, and most features exist to provide a "natural" language interface that is de-abstracted by a compiler

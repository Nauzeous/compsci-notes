A ==programming paradigm== is **"a way of doing things"**

Most programming languages follow a paradigm, and are fairly similar as a result.
Different programming languages may have different syntax but share underlying concepts.
eg. Python, Visual Basic, and C#  come from the same family of languages

# Turing complete

for a programming language to be ==Turing complete==, it must be able to solve **any computable problem**
Even though most programming languages are Turing complete, meaning you can use any language to do anything you want, certain languages are more effective than others at specific problems

# Low and high-level languages

All programming languages can be classed in two ways
- ==high level==
- ==low level==

Ascending levels:
Hardware -> machine code -> assembly -> high level languages ->  object-oriented/ higher level languages

anything higher level than assembly is considered a high level language

High level languages are also classified further:
- **imperative** - statements that change the program's state, telling the computer what to do
	- object-oriented - modular approach to programming (classes, methods, inheritance etc)
	- procedural - program built from many subroutines (procedures/functions)
- **declarative** - tells the computer what the program should accomplish
	  ==declarative languages are not covered in the spec==
	- logic 
	- functional

Object oriented vs procedural

### Features
Object oriented:
- Inheritance, objects, classes, encapsulation
- Sequence, selection, iteration
Procedural:
- Sequence, selection, iteration

### Data
OO:
- stored in attributes and concealed through encapsulation
Procedural:
- stored in local or global variables

### Structure
OO:
- Classes, methods, instances
Procedural:
- procedures and functions

### Logic
OO:
- based on models and behaviours
Procedural
- chains of procedure calls

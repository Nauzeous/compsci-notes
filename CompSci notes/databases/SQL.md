A common query language for databases is the Structured query language or SQL

SQL was developed in the 1970s and allows for fast and efficient data retrieval, deletion, and manipulation in relational databases

SQL is a declarative language, meaning it states what needs to be achieved, unlike a [[Procedural Languages|procedural Language]], which would express the logic of how something needs to be achieved

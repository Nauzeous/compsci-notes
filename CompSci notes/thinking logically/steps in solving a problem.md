it is important to consider the order of the steps taken to solve a problem

the order in which steps are going to be taken by a user is unpredictable, this means that the features of software have to be coded in a way that they can be accessed by the user at any time in any order

some problems involve a predictable sequence of steps, ie. booking movie tickets follow a fairly simple order, and the user should not be able to book seats before paying

it is important, when solving a problem, to consider whether the order of steps matters

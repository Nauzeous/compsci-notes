children are born at what is essentially the top of maslows hierarchy of needs
YC = young children (toddlers/babies/idk what but up to like 6/7 years old)
this doesnt apply to children without parents or authoritative figures
that is 
1st (top):
- self actualisation - personal growth/self-fulfillment 
- YC have little to fulfill, but they have personal growth since it is early life and there is lots to do
2nd:
- esteem - prestige/achievement/recognition
- they get plenty of recognition by virtue of being young, having people oversee them
3rd:
- belonging - love/connection/relationships
- obvious, parents and friends for them are a given
4th:
- safety - resources/security
- very high security, most things are done for them
5th:
- physiological - food/shelter/warmth/sleep
- they have this provided for them

by seeing what YC at the top of the pyramid want, you can see what is their [[final goal]]

lethal company type streamer bait horror game w inbuilt voicechat

takes place in an abandoned city or something similar (not too plagiarisey)


camera mechanics like lethal company (ie. cant look at certain types of creature)

**creature that keeps you locked facing it, turns off your voicechat**

occasionally players will be separated from rest of group and voicechat is off



## limbo mode

when players are locked out of voicechat, maintain connection but only through basic pings, which ==can be imitated== by other creatures

imitation can be done by copying other players habits in the way that they ping

when in limbo mode, the only way to escape is friendly fire, another player must stab the limbo player


some implementation where players try to guess what other players are trying to get them to do

maybe overview where the ghost players can see where the living players are looking and going

data mining is the concept of analysing large amounts of data to discover trends and new information (big data)

the scale of data is that it must be analysed computationally via data mining techniques

data can be collected on anything:
- mouse movement/scroll distance on a webpage
- the average amount of time someone spends to walk through a store

finding even the smallest trends is very helpful for large companies, as it allows them to manage business much easier

for example:
- a supermarket can figure out the time of year where people buy the most soup, and buy more soup/ more variations of soup in preparation for that time

data mining is applicable in many areas, to name a few:
- weather modelling
- economics / markets
- science/engineering
- medical research
- law enforcement

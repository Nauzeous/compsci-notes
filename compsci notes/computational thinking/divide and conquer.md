divide and conquer is a technique that reduces the size of a problem with each successive iteration

a good example of a divide and conquer algorithm is a binary search, which divides the length of the list by a factor of 2 with each iteration

divide and conquer as a concept works well with exponentially larger data sets, so it is good for working with search features and databases

abstraction helps transform a complex problem into one that can be handled by a computer

simulations can involve thousands of microscopic external factors, but abstraction ignores these, making calculations simpler/faster

games also use abstraction

when using abstraction (particularly in a game), you should be thinking:
- what is mandatory (for the game) to retain distinctness or a sufficient sense of realism
- what can be left so the game remains fun to play

problem decomposition can be reduced to 

"the process of taking a large problem and breaking it down into several smaller problems"

depending on on the scale of the problem, the smaller problems can be broken down further

you usually repeat the process until each lowest-level problem is a single task or action, which can be coded as a procedure/module/function/method


it is easier to break down some problems than others

problems that are event-driven: something based around user input like a GUI are harder to break down as they may not follow a set sequence

it is still important to decompose these types of problems though

step-wise refinement is an approach to producing a  [[identify components of a solution|top down modular design]]

when you have a modular design, on top of the other obvious benefits, it is easier to distribute work in a team, ie. a single person can work on a function

heuristics is a way of approaching a problem that sacrifices the certainty of a perfect solution for the sake of finding a *sufficient* solution in a shorter time

heuristics can be thought of as an educated guess

by trading off the perfect solution for an "alright" one, you can make large improvements on time complexity, even making intractable / NP problems into tractable / P problems

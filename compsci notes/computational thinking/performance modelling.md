performance modelling is the process of approximating how well models perform using mathematics, often involving interpolating/extrapolating data

an example is a server setup, you would like to test its performance at maximum capacity, but do not want to bring it to max capacity for any number of reasons

you could instead look at how it performs at a lower level of strain, and extrapolate its performance at higher strain

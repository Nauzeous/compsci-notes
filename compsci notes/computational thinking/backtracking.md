backtracking is the process of building towards a solution, abandoning progress where it is clear the solution is unreachable

a helpful analogy is a maze, as soon as you find a dead end, you turn back and reach the last decision point (branch in paths) you were at

you are backtracking from the dead end to the branch point, and you may backtrack to further previous branch points, if the entire branch is a dead end

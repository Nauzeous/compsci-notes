you can technically write code in notepad, but you cant run the code in notepad, since it doesnt have a built in compiler/interpreter

you would have to run the code from command line

Basic text editors dont include tools like syntax highlighting or debugging tools, but IDEs do

an IDE is a program that provides tools to maximise programmer productivity

some examples of extra tools:
- multi-window editing
- syntax highlighting
- autocomplete
- automatic indentation
- integrated debugger

IDEs have a lot of variance, some with different or more features

the ones that are required on the spec

code editors : text area to enter code directly into the IDE and supports syntax highlighting, autocomplete etc.

error diagnostics : reports errors in the code

run-time environments : software that lets you run programs while developing

translators : a compiler or interpreter or any alternative

auto-documentation : tracks variables, modules and anything else that would help with program maintainability

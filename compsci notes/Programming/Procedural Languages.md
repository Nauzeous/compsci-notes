Procedural languages are one of the most common programming paradigms
Most beginner languages are procedural
Also known as ==Imperative languages== (meaning - "to give an order or instruction")

Procedural languages tell computers precisely what to do in several steps

Code is developed in a ==modular== way. Blocks of code identify set tasks that need to be completed
To achieve this, **Procedures** and **Functions** are used

It is required to be able to read, write, trace and amend procedural program code for the spec
The exam board does not specify a specific procedural language to learn, but some examples are
- C#
- Python
- Visual basic
as the concepts are shared between languages, most differences are in syntax
### Features of procedural languages

- variables
- constants
- selection
- iteration
- sequence

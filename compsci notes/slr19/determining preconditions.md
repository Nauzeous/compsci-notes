problems have a set of preconditions that affect how you create a solution

a precondition is a condition that already exists and could affect how you devise a solution to a problem

another way of thinking of preconditions are as limitations

eg.
if you want to buy a car, some preconditions to consider are:
- how many people need to fit in the car
- what you need to use it for
- how much money you have

the type of car that you buy depends on all of these preconditions

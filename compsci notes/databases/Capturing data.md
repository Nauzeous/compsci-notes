When working with databases, data needs to be handled in four distinct ways:
- capturing
- selecting
- managing
- exchanging

A large amount of data is captured using paper-based data capture forms

Data input on paper is primarily manual and involves reading the paper and entering the information into a computer

For the data entry process to be as efficient and reliable as possible, various tactics are used when designing the data capture form

eg.
- every part of the form is labelled
- must complete form in black pen
- must complete form in capital letters
- tick boxes
- enter each letter in a separate box

## automating data capture

### optical character recognition

to speed up data input, you can use optical character recognition or OCR

OCR automatically reads text by interpreting the shape of specific letters
the character recognition works much better with printed text than with messy handwriting

The post office uses OCR to read postcodes automatically

Road cameras also use OCR to recognise number plates for legal and other purposes

### optical mark recognition

optical mark recognition or OMR can be used to read inputs on multiple choice tests or lottery tickets

OMR is very fast and efficient, and has minimal error rate

Some other ways to automate data capture:
- magnetic strips
- chips (like credit card chips)
- barcodes
- QR codes
- sensors

# Selecting data

Once information is captured in a database, you need an efficient way to retrieve it

A common way to do this is with a query language, such as SQL (structured query language)

SQL was developed in the 1970s and  is used for fast and efficient data retrieval, deletion and manipulation

It does this with the simple set of commands:
- select - field
- from - data set
- where - condition is met

While SQL was developed, so was QBE (Query by Example)
QBE was the first graphical query language, making use of visual tables where the user would enter commands and conditions

many of the graphical front ends of databases like Microsoft Access use ideas developed from QBE

Once a query is built using QBE, it can be converted into statements that can be executed against the database.

By using QBE, the user doesnt have to remember details of SQL syntax

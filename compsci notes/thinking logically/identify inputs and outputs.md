systems are designed to produce an output

when you are certain of your output, you need to work out the required inputs, how many inputs you need, if they need to be dynamically sized, and what type they should be

eg.

a program asks the user for the number of students in a class along with each of their test scores, returning the highest, lowest, and average score

the inputs are the number of students and the scores

the process turns the input into an average, highest, and lowest score

and that data is output

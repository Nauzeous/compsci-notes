Abstraction is the process of removing ideas from reality, and showing exclusively details that are important in a context

abstraction is used in:
- symbols
- legends (think map-legend)
- colour-coding
- icons

icons represent a function or process in a compact efficient way

there are subcategories of abstraction:
- procedural
- functional
- data
- problem

### procedural
procedural abstraction abstracts the real values in a computation 

algebra is an example of a procedural abstraction: $$ 3\times 5 = 15 $$becomes $$ a \times b = c$$
### functional
functional abstraction reduces a process to its inputs and outputs, treating the function like a black box

```
def add5(x):
	return x + 5

result = add5(3)
```
while the abstraction is not needed here, it can be seen that the code within add5 is irrelevant, and all that matters is that it takes 3 and returns 8

### data 
data abstraction isolates how a compound data structure is used from the details of its construction

an example is a variable, it is a memorable keyword that refers to an address in memory, which would be much harder

**not sure on the example - video did not provide one**

### problem
simplifying a problem in order to make it easier to approach - can apply previous approaches/intuition to a problem

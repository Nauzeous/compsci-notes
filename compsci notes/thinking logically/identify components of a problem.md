most real-world problems are multi-faceted and complex, so it is important to identify the individual parts of a bigger problem

### top down modular design

a common approach to solving a large problem is to break it down into a **top-down modular design diagram** using a method called **stepwise refinement**

by using top-down design, the task is split into smaller sub-tasks 

the aim is to end up with sub-tasks that perform a single function and can be tackled as small and independent modules

abstractions like the london tube map are not a true representation, but they convey the context specific information better than a "true" representation

abstraction is important for designing systems like a file system, the user does not need to know physically where on the hard drive it is, they just need to be able to create, move.... with the files

abstraction in a file system also allows for more logical sorting of files; folders have little physical meaning but make it much easier to sort and search for files

another example is a sat-nav

the most important things when driving are the roads, so the roads must be shown

the rocks or trees on the side of the road are irrelevant to the driver, thus it would be better to not show them, or minimise them visually, to not distract the user

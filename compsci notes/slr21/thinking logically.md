decisions are very important, and are usually represented by boolean expressions

a boolean expression means the expression returns **either TRUE or FALSE**

boolean expressions are usually evaluated as a part of a selection statement like *if*

they can also be evaluated inside a loop, like *for* or *while* or *until*

*if* is used for branching in one direction, but *if-else* is useful for a true/false situation

for 3+ paths, it is best to use a *switch* statement, or a language dependent equivalent like *match-case* for python
```
match n:
	case 1:
		...
	case 2:
		...
```

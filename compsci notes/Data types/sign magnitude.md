sign magnitude is another less used method of representing negative binary numbers

the first bit is used to represent sign, the rest of the bits are used to represent a magnitude/absolute value  $|x|$

the advantage of this method is that it is easier to understand and convert between negative and positive numbers

the disadvantage is that there is two methods of storing 0, as positive and negative 0 are included, this results in a range decrease of 1

it is very important to have a final goal, it is what you will do at the end of something, and ultimately the driving force in what you do

parallels:
i got GM in overwatch but didnt really want to do it for any reason other than wanting to be a high rank and flex it to people
as a result i didnt like playing the game and got very bored, noone really cared anymore

I have seen plenty of threads on twitter/reddit about people who are financially independent/retired at a young age, and all they do is play games and smoke weed all day

whether this is really their ultimate goal, or a substitute for a lack of one is fairly irrelevant, it shows that there is something more important than achieving success, that is the reason why you want to do so

it seems fairly obvious you would want to win, but when you are trying everyday to do so, it is hard to not scrutinize the reasons, or strawman them to avoid difficult sitations

discipline is a substitute for this, used by stupid people who dont have a real reason to do things other than "i dont want to, which means i should"

while it is respectable to do things that you dont want to do, usually that is accomodated by an ultimate end goal that spurs the desire to do things that you wouldnt do otherwise


### my final goal

when i am done with it all:

this is a tough problem, otherwise everyone wouldnt struggle with it

apply the japanese concept of ikigai

that is, the intersection of:
- what you are good at
- what you love
- what the world needs
- what can you be paid for

this is good for a business perspective

when you are retired, what do you need to do that you can be paid for, or that the world needs

for someone in a non-capitalist vacuum, the ideal combo is what you are good at and what you love

this encompasses passion

i like

1. difficult logic problems - likely because they are difficult problems that can be solved without prereq knowledge
2. music
3. trying to continually improve upon silly numbers (elo rating, runtime in programs, compactness in code/games, speedrunning) - is this an ego thing?
4. nature 
5. climbing (links to 4)
6. art (shaders/3d art/2d art) also links to 4

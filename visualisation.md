visualising something allows for much higher information bandwidth : " a picture tells a thousand words "

it is much easier to understand the structure of a graph by drawing it out, rather than staring at an adjacency matrix

this is why using flow diagrams to illustrate the logic / control flow of a program/algorithm is important before implementing it in code

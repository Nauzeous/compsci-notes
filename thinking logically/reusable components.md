reusing code is very useful, although copying someone elses code does not help you become better at programming

reusing code:
- shortens development time/costs
- removes redundant code
- saves system resources

a good example of reusing code is using functions/methods/procedures/subroutines

using these blocks of code prevents you from repeating yourself and wasting lines

you can also use library routines, which mean the functions are defined and precompiled for you

code can also be reused in components when making multiple apps, especially if they are bundled together: ie microsoft office

components can also be used through an external api (application programming interface), as with many large websites like spotify, facebook, google etc. 

linking social media accounts are an example of api use, allowing you to find people from your contacts if allowed by the user

for an example structure, use a point with an x and y coordinate, both of which are integers

this can be declared as

```
struct point{
	int x;
	int y;
};
```
the keyword struct declares a structure, which is a list of declarations enclosed in the curly braces

you can also add a name (point) called a structure tag, before the braces

the variables in a structure are called members

variables inside and outside of a struct can have the same name as they can be distinguished by context

similarly different structs can have the same variable names

although you should probably make unique names for each variable

a struct can be used as a custom type, that reserves no storage until used as a template

```
struct {...} x, y, z;
```
defines x, y, and z as that specific *struct* type

you can also reuse the struct definition if you have a structure tag (ie. point)

```
struct point pt1,pt2,pt3;
```
declares 3 points of custom type *point*

a structure can be initialized by following its definition with a list of initializers

ie.
```
struct point p1 = {40,20};
```

to access a member of the struct, just use .

```
printf("%d", p1.x);
```
prints 40

a function can return a struct type

```
struct point makepoint(int x, int y){
	struct point temp;

	temp.x = x;
	temp.y = y;
	return temp;
}
```

structures cannot be used in the same way as other types for variables

the only legal operations are copying it, assigning to it, taking its address with &, and accessing its members

structures cant be compared (<,>,\==)

If you are passing a large structure or any large piece of data to a function, it is better to pass a pointer than to copy the whole thing

when declaring pointers to structures use the syntax

```
struct point *p
```

when accessing members of \*p, use brackets

```
*p.x;
```
doesnt work, use
```
(*p).x;
```

pointers to structures are used often to another notation to use is 

p-> member-of-structure

so the equivalent would be
```
p->x
```

structure operators like . and -> are at the top of the precedence hierarchy along with () and \[]

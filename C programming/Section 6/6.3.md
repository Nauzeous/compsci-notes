an example of an array of structures is a dictionary, for something like counting keywords in a C program

you can use two parallel arrays

```
char *keyword[NKEYS];
int keycount[NKEYS];
```
since these arrays are used in parallel (5th element of keycount pertains to the 5th element of keyword)

this means that you can create an array where each element is a struct of a pair of elements, namely

```
struct key{
	char *word;
	int count;
} keytab[NKEYS]
```

and the array can be initialised

```
struct key keytab[] = {
	{"auto",0},
	{"break",0},
	....
}
```

any of the three parts in a for loop can be omitted, but the semicolons must be there

```
for (expr1;expr2;expr3)
```

is the same as 

```
expr1;
while (expr2){
	statement;
	expr3;
}
```
if the test, expr2 is not present, it is permanently true, so the loop goes on forever

a trick in for loops is to include expr3 in expr2

ie.

```
for(i=0;i++<30;)
```

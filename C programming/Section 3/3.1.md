an expression becomes a statement when followed by a semicolon

ie.

```
x = 0;
i++;
printf(...);
```

the semicolon is a statement terminator

braces {} are used to group declarations and statements together into a compound block/statement, so they are equivalent to a single statement according to syntax

an example is after an if statement or in a loop

```
for(i=0;i<30;i++){....}
if(a<b){...}
```

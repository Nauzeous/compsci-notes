the switch statement is another way to test a multi-way decision

it works by checking whether an expression matches one of multiple constant integer values

ie.

```
switch (expression){
	case 1: statement(s)
	case 2: statement(s)
	...
	default: statement(s)
}
```

the default line is executed is none of the cases match

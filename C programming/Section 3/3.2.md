an if-else statement is used to expression decisions

the else part of an if-else statement is optional

an if tests the numeric value of an expression, as any non zero expression is evaluated as true

ie.

if (expression)

instead of 

if (expression != 0)

although sometimes the latter makes more sense

when using nested ifs, use braces and indentation

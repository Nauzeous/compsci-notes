a sequence of else if statements is the most general way of making a multi-way decisions

the expressions are evaluated in order, and if any expression is true, the statement associated with it is executed and the if-else chain is terminated

example for a binary search

```
int binsearch(int x, int v[], int n){ /* x is search item, v is list, n is list length */
	int low, high, mid;
	low = 0;
	high = n - 1;

	while (low <= high){
		mid = (low + high)/2;
		if (x<v[mid])
			high = mid - 1;
		else if (x>v[mid])
			low = mid + 1;
		else /* found match */
			return mid;
	}
	return -1; /* no match */
}
```

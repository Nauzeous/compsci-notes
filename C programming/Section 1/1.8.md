In C, all function arguments are passed "by value"

This means that the called function is given the values of its arguments in temporary variables rather than the originals

This leads to some different properties than are seen with "call by reference" languages

In C, the called function cannot directly alter a variable in the calling function, and can only alter its own temporary copy

for example:

```
int add(int a, int b){
	int p = 1;
	a = a + b
	return a
}
```

in this short program, the parameter a (passed in from main) will not be changed outside the add function

However, if you want to alter a global variable inside a loop, the caller can provide the memory address of the variable to be set (a ==pointer== to the variable)

passing in arrays is different, they cannot be called by value, and a pointer to the start of the array is sent to the subroutine/function

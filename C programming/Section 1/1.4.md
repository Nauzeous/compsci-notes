it is important to make numbers meaningful, so code can be parsed easily, preventing "magic numbers" that are integral to an algorithm but convey little information to someone who has to read the algorithm later

a way around this is to create a symbolic name/constant to be a particular string

ie.
\# define *name* *replacement text*

rewriting the fahrenheit-celsius program with this

```
#include <stdio.h>	
#define LOWER 0
#define UPPER 300
#define STEP 20
	
int main(){
	for (int fahr = LOWER; fahr <= UPPER; fahr = fahr + STEP)
		printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
	return 0;
}
```

it is important to note there is no semicolon at the end of a \#define line

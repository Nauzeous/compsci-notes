functions are useful to encapsulate computation

With good functions, it is possible to ignore how a job is done; knowing what is done is sufficient

an example of a way to use functions

```
int power(int base, int n){
	int p = 1;
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i){
		p = p \* base;
	}
	return base
}
```

the parameteres are named between the parentheses, along with their types

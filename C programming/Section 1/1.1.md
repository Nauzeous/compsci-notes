\#include <stdio.h>

```
int main(){
	printf("hello, world\\n");
	return 0;
}
```
print "hello, world"

new lines are not done by default, the \\n is required to do so

other \\n like characters are:
- \\\\t for tab 
- \\\\b for backspace
- \\\\" for the double quote
- \\\\\\ for the backslash itself
full list in [[2.3]]

differs from book as functions are required to return a value even if part of the main loop

to declare an array, use a line similar to

```
int ndigit[10]
```

this declares ndigit to be an array of 10 integers

arrays are zero-indexed so the first element is ndigit\[0], second ndigit\[1] and so on

a subscript (number inside box brackets) can be any integer expression, so any integer variable or constant.

not much else to say

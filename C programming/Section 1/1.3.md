with the previous program that converts fahrenheit to celsius, a while loop is not required.

a better way to implement a solution would be using a for loop

the syntax for a for loop is 
```
for (int fahr = 0; fahr <= 300; fahr = fahr + 20)
	printf("%3d %6.1f\n", fahr, (5.0/9.0)*(fahr-32));
```
the for statement is a generalization of the while loop

the initialization is the first part "int fahr = 0", and is done once before the loop is entered

the test/condition is what controls the loop
"fahr <= 300" is evaluated, if true, then the third part, the increment step, is executed, and the loop run, until the condition is re-evaluated.

once the condition is false, the loop terminates

the body of the loop can be a single statement, or a group of statements enclosed in braces "{ }"

the /*  \*/  symbols represent a comment

the type int can be 2 or 4 bytes long (depending on implementation), and can represent numbers from -32,768 to 32,767, for 2 bytes, and -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 for 4

floats are 32 bits, with at least 6 digits and a magnitude between around 10<sup>-38 </sup> and 10<sup>38</sup> 

some other types are 

| char   | 1 byte  | -127 to 127                                                     | single character       |
| ------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| short  | 2 bytes | -32,768 to 32,767                                               | short integer          |
| long   | 8 bytes | roughly Â±9.2 \* 10<sup>18</sup>                                 | long integer           |
| double | 8 bytes | 2.3 \*10<sup>-308</sup> to 1.7\*10<sup>308</sup> around 15 s.f. | double precision float |

the sizes of some types are ==machine-dependent==. 

There are also arrays, structures, and unions of the basic types, pointer to them, and function that return them

## important note on division

integer division truncates, so it is required to do
	celsius = 5*(fahr-32)/9
as opposed to
	celsius = (fahr-32) \*(5/9)
as ==the integer division of 5/9 would be 0, and all resulting celsius measurements would be 0==

## printf

printf is a general-purpose output formatting function

its first argument is a string of characters to be printed, with each % sign indicating where the respective arguments are substituted in, and in what form they are printed.

%d specifies the argument is an integer, so the statement
	printf("%d\\t%d\\n", fahr, celsius);
causes the values of the two integers fahr and celsius to be printed, with a tab between them

each % is paired with the corresponding argument

the arguments must match up by number and type or the answers will be wrong

**it is notable that printf is a part of the standard library of function, not an integral part of C**


### formatting print

the output doesnt look very nice as the numbers are not spaced consistently

this is easy to fix, if each %d has a width, then the numbers will be **right-justified** in their fields

eg.
	printf("%3d %6d\\n", fahr, celsius);
so the first number is in a field 3 digits wide, and the second in a field 6 digits wide


## back to arithmetic

as integer arithmetic is used, the conversions are inaccurate, floating point arithmetic should be used, as opposed to integer arithmetic

this can be done by changing the celsius calculation to

	celsius = (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32.0);
	printf("3.0f %6.1f\n", fahr, celsius)

and by declaring involved variables as floats

the first line simply changes the arithmetic to floating point, by using decimal points

the printf specification for %3.0f means that a floating number (the fahrenheit number) is printed at least three characters wide, with no decimal point and no fraction digits (specified by the .0)

%6.1f specifies another number (celsius) that is printed at least 6 chars wide, with 1 digit after the decimal point (specified by the .1)

width and precision can be omitted, all that is needed is the %f

some other printing formats are %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal, %c for character, %s for character string, and \%\% for % itself

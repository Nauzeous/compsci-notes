the variables inside a function are private/loval to the function, because they are declared inside that function. This means no other function has direct access to them.

Such variables are known as automatic variables

As automatic variables come and go with function invocation, they do not keep their values from one call to the next, and must be set every time the function is called

as an alternative to automatic variables, you can define variables that are external/global to all functions, meaning any function can make use of the variable

these external variables can be used similarly to to arguments and argument lists, for communicating data between functions

an external variable must be defined once outside of any function, and when used in a function, it must be declared using an ==extern== statement, similar to global in python

ie.

```
int a = 2;

int foo(int x){
	extern int a;
	...
	....
	return a;
}
```

a better way to do this would be to declare the variable as external before using it

ie.

```
extern int a;

int foo(int x){
	int a;
	a = 2;
	....
	....
	return x
}
```

therer are other ways to do "global" variables like this, with different scopes

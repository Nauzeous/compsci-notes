constants can be specified with a type by ending the value with a letter like l (lowercase L) for a long int, ul (lower UL) for unsigned long, f for float (although including a decimal point or exponent will suffice), and l (lowercase L) on a decimal will be a long double

the value of an integer can also be specified in octal or hexadecimal instead of regular base 10 decimal

a leading 0 on an integer constant means octal, a leading 0x or 0X means hexadecimal

decimal 31 can be written 037 in octal and 0x1f (not case dependent, 0X1F is equivalent) in hex

octal and hex number constants can be followed by L for *long* and U for *unsigned*

a character constant is stored as an integer and written as a single character between single quotes, ie. 'x' or '2'

certain characters can be represented in character and string constants using escape sequences like \\n

ie. 

\\013 to represent the 11th character in a character set
\\xb to do the same in hexadecimal

| code | what it does                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- |
| \\a  | alert/bell character                    |
| \\b  | backspace                               |
| \f   | formfeed                                |
| \n   | newline                                 |
| \r   | carriage return                         |
| \t   | horizontal tab                          |
| \v   | vertical tab                            |
| \\\  | backslash                               |
| \\?  | question mark                           |
| \\'  | single quote                            |
| \\"  | double quote                            |
| \ooo | octal number (ooo is 3 octal digits)    |
| \xhh | hexadecimal (hh are hexadecimal digits) |

a cool thing to note about constants:
	a constant expression is an expression that involves only constants, and these expressions can be evaluated during compilation instead of runtime

a string constant or string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes, and is stored as an array of characters

string constants can be concatenated in compilation

"hello, " "world" 
is the same as 
"hello, world"

at the end of the character array, there is a null character '\\0' 

it is important to distinguish a string that is 1 character long and a character constant

'x' is a character constant, "x" is a string

there is another type of constant, called the enumeration constant

an enumeration is a list of constant integer values

the first name in an enum has value 0, the next 1, incrementing unless a value is specified, once a value is specified, the next items continue to increment from the specified value

ie.

enum months {JAN = 1, FEB, MAR,APR,MAY,JUN,JUL,AUG,SEP,OCT,NOV,DEC};

FEB is 2, MAR is 3, and so on

the variables in the enumeration are similar to \#define, so JAN can be used as a symbolic constant equal to 1 later in the code

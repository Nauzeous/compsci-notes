There are a few basic data types in C

| type   | explanation                                                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| char   | a single byte, can hold 1 character in the local character set |
| int    | an integer, size dependent on implementation/host machine      |
| float  | single precision floating point                                |
| double | double precision floating point                                |
there are some qualifiers that can be applied to the basic types, like ==short== and ==long==

ie.

short int a;
long int b;

in this scenario the keyword *int* can be omitted

*short* is 16 bits, *long* 32 bits, and the standard *int* either 16 or 32

the qualifiers signed and unsigned can be applied to char or any integer

unsigned numbers are 0 and above, with signed being negative and positive 

whether the standard *char* type is signed or unsigned is also implementation dependent, but any printable character will have a positive value

*long* can also be used in tandem with the *double* type, to add a third level of precision to floating point. going in order of increasing precision 

float -> double -> long double

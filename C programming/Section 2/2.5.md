the binary arithmetic operators are +, -, \*, /, and the modulus operator %

the modulus operator in the operation (x % y) returns the remainder when x is divided by y

% cannot be used on float or double

\+ and - have the same precedence, lower than \*, / and %, which is lower than unary + and - (meaning a single operand ie. y = +x)

operators with the same precedence will go from left to right

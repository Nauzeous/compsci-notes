operators on the same line have the same precedence, and obviously rows are in order of decreasing precedence


| operators                           | associativity |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- |
| () \[] -> .                         | left to right |
| ! ~ ++ -- + - \* & (*type*) sizeof  | right to left |
| \* / %                              | left to right |
| + -                                 | left to right |
| << >>                               | left to right |
| < <= > >=                           | left to right |
| == !=                               | left to right |
| & ^ \|                              | left to right |
| && \|\|                             | left to right |
| ? :                                 | right to left |
| = += -= \*= /= %= &= ^= \|= <<= >>= | right to left |
| ,                                   | left to right |
*unary + - and \* have higher pecedence than binary forms*

==writing code that highly depends on order of evaluation is a bad practice in any language==

some lines dependent on order of evaluation can be interpreted differently by different compilers

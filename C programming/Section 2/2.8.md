there are two operators for incrementing and decrementing variables

- ++
- \---
(it should be obvious which is which)

weirdly, the operators can be used as either prefix operators or postfix (++n and n++ are the same)

in both cases, n is incremented, but the expression ++n increments before its value is used, while n++ increments n after the value is used

for example, if n is 5

x = n++;

n increments to 6, but after x is assigned to the previous value of 5

whereas

x = ++n;

both values are set to 6

if not assigning, then the line

n++;

is valid whether using prefix or postfix

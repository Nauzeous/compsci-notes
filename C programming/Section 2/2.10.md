expressions like

i = i + 2;


can be shortened to 

i += 2;

the operator += is called an assignement operator

lots of binary operators (+,-,\*,/,%,<<,>>,&,^,|) that use left and right operands can be shortened in a similar way following the format

var1 = var1 *operation* var2

is equivalent to

var1 *operation*=var2

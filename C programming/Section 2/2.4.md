all variables must be declared before being used, although certain declarations can be made implicitly

declarations specify type and a list of one or more variables of the type

ie.

```
int lower, upper, step;
char c, line\[100];
```

a variable can also be initialized in its declaration.

ie.

```
int lower = 0;
char esc = '\\'
```

if the variable is not automatic, the initialization, is done once before the program begins

external and static variables are initialized to 0 by default, and automatic variables without an initializer have undefined values

the qualifier const can be applied to the declaration of any variable to specift that its value will not be changed

for an array, the const qualifer says that the elements will not be altered

ie.

```
const double pi = 3.1415926535;
```

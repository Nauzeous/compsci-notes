when an operator has operands of different types (eg. 1 + 2.1) they are converted to a common type according to some rules

usually, automatic conversions convert a "narrow" operand into a "wider" one without losing information, such as converting an integer to a float

expressions that dont make sense, like using float as a subscript (like list\[3.2]) are not allowed

expresions that lose information, like assigning a long int to a short int, or float to int, are not illegal but may draw a warning

relational expressions are defined to have a value 1 if true, and 0 if false

some functions return any non zero value for true, as true just means non-zero

conversion rules are difficult when concerning unsigned operands, the problem is that comparisons are machine dependent, as the storage of two's complement can convert a negative number to a large positive number

converting from float to int causes truncation of any fractional part

when converting from double to float, the value can be either rounded or truncated

explicit type conversions can be done with a unary operator called a ==cast==

ie.

```
(int) 22.0/7.0
```

would return 3

if using a ==function prototype==

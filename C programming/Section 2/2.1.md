there are restrictions on the names of variables and [[1.4|symbolic constants]]

names are made of letters and digits, with the underscore"\_" counting as a letter (helpful for making a long name readable)

beginning variable names with underscores can be problematic though, as library routines use similar nmaes

variable names are also case specific, x and X are two different variables

it is standard to use lower case for variables, and all upper case for symbolic constants

keywords like "if,else,int,float" etc cannot be used as variable names

for practicality, longer names are used for external variables, and short names for local variables, or briefly used variables like loop indices.

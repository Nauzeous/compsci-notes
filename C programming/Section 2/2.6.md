the relational operators are:
- >
- >=
- <
- <=

and they all have the same precedence

below them in precedence are the equality operators
- ==
- !=

relational operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators

expressions connected by && (AND operator) and || (OR operator) are evaluated left to right

the unary negation operator ! inverts an operand, if the operand is 0 it becomes 1, and vice versa

the ! operator is useful when evaluating whether a statement is false 
ie.

if (valid == 0)

is the same as writing 

if(!valid)

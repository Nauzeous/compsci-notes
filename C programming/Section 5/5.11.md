a function is not a variable but you can assign pointers to functions

```
void qsort(void *lineptr[],int left, int right, int(*comp)(void *, void *))
```

this is the declaration for a quicksort function that takes a list of numbers or strings, the left and right item (for recursion purposes), and a pointer to the function to use for comparison 

if comparing strings, pass a pointer to the strcmp function, likewise, pass a pointer to the numcmp function if comparing numbers

memory is an array of consecutively numbered cells that can be manipulated individually or in contiguous groups. 

a pointer is a two or four bytes that hold an address

the unary operator & gives the address of an object, so 

```
p = &c;
```

assigns the address of c to p

it is then said that p points to c

the operator only applies to objects in memory ie. variables

the unary operator \* is the dereferencing operator, and when applied to a pointer, accesses the object that the pointer points to

example of declaring a pointer and using & and \*

```
int x=1,y=2,z[10];
int *ip;    /* ip is a pointer to an int */

ip = &x;    /* ip now points to x */
y = *ip;    /* y is now 1, the value of x */
*ip = 0;    /* x is now 0 */
ip = &z[0]; /* ip now points to z[0] */
```

the expression 
```
int *ip
```
means that the expression \*p is an int 

pointers are constrained to point to a specific data type, but 
```
void *x
```

is used to hold any type of pointer than cannot be dereferenced


it is important to note that unary operators operate from right to left, so to increment a dereferenced pointer, you must use 

```
++*ip;
```
or
```
(*ip)++;
```

pointers are not only useful for dereferencing, and can be used as variables

ie.
```
ip=iq;
```

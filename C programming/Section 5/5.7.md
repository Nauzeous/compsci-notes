C allows you to make n-dimensional rectangular arrays, and they are declared similarly to python

```
static int daytab[2][13] = {
	{0,31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31},
	{0,31,29,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31}
} 
```

and is indexed with two (or more) subscripts

an N-dimensional array is just a one dimensional array, each of whose elements is an array of (N-1) dimensions, allowing for unlimited dimensions

if an n-dimensional array is declared as an input to a function, it must be declared in a similar way, that is:

```
foo(int daytab[2][13])
```

==important note:==

int \*daytab\[13] is an array of 13 pointers to integers
int (\*daytab)\[13] is a pointer to an array of 13 integers

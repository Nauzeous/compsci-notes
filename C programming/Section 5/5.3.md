pointers and arrays are intertwined strongly, array subscripts are just pointer addition, of the array start and an index

```
array[1];
```

is the same as

```
*(&array+1);
```

and the & is not even needed, the variable array is already a memory address at the start of the array


since all array subscripting does is pointer arithmetic, you can index backwards in an array, and arr\[-1] is allowed, and will return the elements that precede arr\[0]

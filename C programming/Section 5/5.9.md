pointer arrays and multi-dimensional arrays can be confused, as they are very similar in usage and syntax

eg.
```
int a[10][20];
int *b[10];
```
subscripting either array works just fine, so a\[1]\[2] is used the same as b\[1]\[2]

however, the length of rows/columns (however you imagine 2d arrays) in the pointer array is variable, unlike the array a, where the data is contiguous

2d arrays are needed for storing an array of strings, as strings are each an array of characters

this means that 

```
char aname[][15] = {"Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb","Mar"};
```
would pad each part of the array if there is less than 15 characters to store

whereas 
```
char *name[] = {"Illegal month", "Jan", "Feb","Mar"};
```

would not pad characters, as each pointer points to a character array with its own length

there is a way to pass command-line arguments to a program when it starts executing

when main is called, it is called with 2 arguments, namely:
- argc - argument count
- argv - argument vector, a pointer to an array of character strings that contain the arguments

argv\[0] is the name by which the program was invoked, so argc is at least 1 by default

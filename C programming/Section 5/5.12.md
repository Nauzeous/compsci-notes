when declaring pointers or things relating to pointers, the syntax can greatly affect how the compiler interprets the declaration

eg.
```
int *f();
```
is a function returning a pointer to an integer

whereas
```
int (*f)();
```
is a pointer to a function returning an integer

this is because \* is a prefix operator with lower precedence than (), so parentheses are needed to enforce the intended order of evaluation

any \*() will make a pointer to whatever is in the brackets

so 
```
int (*daytab[13])
```
is a pointer to an array, 13 long

and 
```
int *daytab[13]
```
if an array of pointers to integers

```
void (*comp)()
```
is a pointer to a function returning void

```
char (*(*x())[]))()
```
is a function returning a pointer to an array of pointers to functions returning characters

these are stupid and you will probably never have to do complicated declarations like this; you are probably doing something wrong if you do

the preprocessor is a part of compilation

\#include and \#define are parts of the preprocessor


### file inclusion

file inclusion allows you to handle collections of declarations

a source line of the form

```
#include "filename"
```
or 
```
#include <filename>
```
is replaced by the contents of the file

the "" include searches for the file in the source program directory

if not found using that method, or the filename is in < >, searching follows an implementation defined rule

included files can contain other include lines

### macros

a definition like

```
#define name replacement-text
```

calls a macro substitution, where the compiler replaces every instance of the name with the replacement text

substitutions are only made for tokens (words separated by a space)

macros can take arguments, like

```
#define max(A,B) ((A)>(B)?(A):(B))
```
although this may be incorrect sometimes, as macros can ignore operators like the post-increment, so max(i++,j) would be evaluated as

```
(i++>j) ? i++ : j
```

which would increment i twice, and possibly return a wrong answer

order of evaluation also needs to be considered, and brackets used liberally

if you use the macro
```
#define square(x) x*x
```
and invoke 
```
square(y+1)
```
the compiler would read

```
y+1*y+1
```
which is not the same as  squaring (y+1)

### conditional inclusion

preprocessing can be controlled with conditional statements

\#if evaluates a constant integer expression, and if non-zero, then the following lines are executed until an \#endif, \#elif, or \#else

when declared and not initialised, a static or external variable is 0

undefined automatic and register variables have undefined values

for external and static variables, the initialiser must be a constant expression, as there is no higher scope they can refer to, in order to assign a value

worth noting again, any constant expression, or function on a constant, is evaluated at compiler time, and will not slow down the program

for example:

```
int times10(int x){
	int n=0;
	while (n != x*10 ){
		n+=x;
	}
	return n;
}

int y = times10(10);
```

this stupid inefficient code will be fixed by the compiler, and y will be initialised as 100

for automatic and register variables, the initialiser can be any expression involving pre-defined values

for initialising arrays, curly braces can be used, and the size of the array omitted

for example:

```
int days[] = {31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31}
```

character arrays are initialised with double quotes (")

so

```
char pattern[] = "ould";
```

is the same thing as writing

```
char pattern[] = {'o','u','l','d','\0'};
```

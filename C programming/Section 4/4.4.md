functions and external variables dont need to be compiled at the same time

the scope of a name is the part of the program where the name can be used.

for an automatic variable, the scope is the function is which it is defined

the scope of an external variable is from when it is declared to the end of the file

```
for(int i = 1; i < 10; i ++){
	....
}
```

in this codeblock i can only be used inside the loop, so its scope is the loop

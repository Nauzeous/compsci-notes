a register declaration advises the compiler that the variable will be heavily used

this could mean that they are placed in machine registers, but this may not always be the case, as the compiler makes the ultimate decision

an example:

```
register int x;
register char c;
```

the register declaration can only be applied to automatic variables and to the declared arguments of a function

as with other things in C, there are restrictions that rely on hardware, and only a few variables in each function can be kept in registers, and only certain types are allowed
